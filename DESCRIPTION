Description: DeeDee is a collection of functions to compare the results of two 
    or more Differential Expression Analyses. From data preparation to different
    forms of graphic output, DeeDee has your back. Aside from a data preparation 
    function and six graphical-output producing functions, the package contains
    a Shiny web application that contains the package's full functionality and 
    more.
