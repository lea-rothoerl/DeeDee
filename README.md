# DeeDee 

The package DeeDee provides a user-friendly framework for the visual comparison of two or more results from Differential Expression Analysis workflows. 

It contains eight exported functions: one for the data preparation, six for the actual graphical output-producing comparison functions, and the last one opens an interactive Shiny App. The App comprises the functionality of all functions, combining them with an easy to use graphical user interface.
