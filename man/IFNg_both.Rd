\title{A sample \code{res_enrich} object}
\description{
A sample \code{res_enrich} object, generated with the \code{topGOtable} function (from
the \code{pcaExplorer} package).
}
\details{
This \code{res_enrich} object on the data from the \code{macrophage} package
has been created by analyzing downstream the differentially expressed genes
when comparing IFNg treated samples vs naive samples, accounting
for the different cell lines included.

Details on how this object has been created are included in the \code{create_gt_data.R}
script, included in the \code{scripts} folder of the \code{GeneTonic} package.
